			STKLOS-GTK-CANVAS

This is a simple binding of GooCanvas GTK+ functions for STklos. This
binding intensively uses the STklos FFI and is mostly written in
Scheme. The binding is quite direct and programming interfaces with it
is low level and very similar to programming a goocanvas in C. A
simple example of canvas usage is given in the example directory.
